# DFSSearch

## What did I do?
- Implement a basic 'map'/'maze' library which includes a goal state and walls
- Employ a DFS search to find a route from a given start node to the goal node
- Use a Makefile to automate the compilation and building of the project

## What did I learn?
- Got to grips with basic C++ syntax
- Experimented with Makefiles and their benefits
- Recapped various C topics such as pointers
- Learned some basic tools of the C++ standard library
- Learned how to build upon the C++ standard library to build reuseable tools for my project e.g. .h files, custom types, etc.

## EBI
- Experiment with other searching algorithms
- Improve the map, e.g. a proper maze may have been more interesting
- Implement an escape for there being no valid route
