# Card Game

## Premise
This project was my first proper dive into the Godot engine (aside from following along with basic tutorials online)

## What I learnt
- Godot being a node-based game engine introduced me to this concept of hierarchical tree structures in game design.
<br><br>
- Working on game designs in general has introduced me to the pros and cons of object-orientated systems. I was forced to consider how to best set-up an inheritance-based approach which would allow for greater code flexibility and adaptability at later stages in the project. I feel I handled this approach well.
<br><br>
- Further to the above point, I endeavoured to code in adherence to basic 'clean code' principles.<br><br>Equally, this led me down a research-rabbit-hole of: "Is clean code good?". Consider this famous video ["Clean" Code, Horrible Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU) which combats the idea of clean code demonstrating its clear impacts on performance. Additionally, this article [It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code](https://qntm.org/clean) and this commentary of said article [Stop Recommending Clean Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqHaGd9J42s). <br><br>Up until this point, I had devoutly believed clean code to be superior due to its importance in software maintainability, however, this research has led me to consider opposing views. Due to Godot's optamisation, this was purely a theoretical exercise; realistically, I need not worry about optamisation for a simple card game, considering its only run locally (on my rather powerful computer). Considering this for future projects may prove useful

## EBI
The project is by no means complete, there are notable and obvious bugs, the sprites are still essentially placeholders, and the human/computer interfacing leaves plenty to be desired. At this stage, I wish to explore other fields in the Computer Science sphere. 

Were I to resume this project at any point, the best place to start would be to resume constructing the combat system, and ultimately add more features as the gams is currently very bare bones
