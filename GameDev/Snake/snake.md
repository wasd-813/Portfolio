# Overview

The aim of this was project was to re-familiarize myself with the syntax of python as well as experiment with OOP in python.

The [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library was used to create this game. As a result I gathered more experience in reading and understanding formal documentation as opposed to following tutorials online.The manner in which I used and applied this library was not necessarily the developer intended way. Namely, I neglected to use this concept of: sprites & groups, which according to the documentation is a highly important feature of the Library. This is something I will look to experiment with in a later project: [Pong](../Pong/pong.md)

An unexpected side benefit was learning more about the use of venvs.
