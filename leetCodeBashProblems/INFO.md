# leetCodeBashProblems

This directory serves as a simple playground for any [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems I've attempted that include the running of bash (.sh) scripts. Leetcode's in-built environment for testing and running bash scripts is not ideal and so this directory allows for me to run tests locally.
